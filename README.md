# Seattle AirBNB


## Executive Summary:

  Air BNB is trying to figure out if a vibe can be determined by the listings description, when is the busiest times and how much do prices spike during the busiest times, is there an upward trend between new listings and Air BNB visitors to Seattle. SQL is the desired program with millions of rows from 3 data sets for calandar, listings and reviews.(datasets from kaggle)


### Business Problem: 

  Air BNB is trying to find new ways to market their business by using what kind of vibe each neighbourhood gives off in their Seattle division to help increase visitors. They want to also find the busiest times throughout the year so they are able to prepare their marketing in advanced while also giving out discounts for expensive BNB's that might not get as much attention during the busier months to help fill those properties up as well. Finally, they want to be sure that the properties coming in are matching well with the visitors they are getting to Seattle each year.


### Methodology: 

1. SQL- data cleaning, SQL functions (basic and complex), data visualization

### Skills:

They recieved a visual and report on the busiests times of the year starting in June and going to August with prices spiking as high as 1.68%. They finally received a report which stated that the increase in properties was keeping up very well with the amount of visitors increase to Seattle each yeat.
